Pass cnf'd terms to rule clauses for faster matching?

Grammar based (impl-freeo?) much faster.

(sentence p) (sentence q) outside of each clause in impl-freeo generates less interesting, occasionally repetitive results.
naive (impl-freeo?) much slower (non-responsive) than (sentence) in (nnfo).

Instead of a rule for each associative/commutative/order difference, normalize to fixed order and scan again.
